# Hello! I'm Alex

I am a **product manager** and experienced in **AI and data science**.

I created **NLP** pipelines on materials data when I was at MIT, used **active learning** to design better materials at Citrine Informatics, and applied **reinforcement learning** to solve industrial control problems at Microsoft Bonsai. 

I am currently working as a **Product Manager** at **Microsoft Fabric** - Microsoft's new data platform. There I build Data Copilots. 

I think **AI is the key technology of this century**, and while I think its super promising, unless we're thoughtful and deliberate about deploying it I think we may face some considerable, and potentially existential, consequences. 

I think to apply AI in a thoughtful and deliberate way, we need more people who can work and communicate across domains. I tried to get a broad education, and have degrees in:
- MS Technology & Policy - MIT
- MS Computer Science - MIT 
- MEng Advanced Manufacturing & Design - MIT
- BEng Mechanical Engineering - University of Edinburgh

I am a global citizen! I grew up moving every 2-4 years, and have lived in the Netherlands üá≥üá±, Singapore üá∏üá¨, Indonesia üáÆüá©, the Bahamas üáßüá∏, France üá´üá∑, Scotland üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø, and the USA üá∫üá∏. Always looking to connect with fellow **Third Culture Kids**! Reach out if you happen to stumble across me.

# What I Do

<img src="/assets/images/fabric-logo.png" alt="Fabric" width="90">

At **[Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric)** I am a **Product Manager** on the founding team of the **copilots initiative**. Here we try to imbue the new flagship data platform with AI capabilities. Imagine writing things like "*please analyze this dataset for anomalies*" and actually getting timesaving and trustworthy results. 

You can see some of the initial features we will ship [here](https://youtu.be/jt6oq2CjaiA?t=338).

# What I did
### Reinforcement Learning for Industrial Control

At **[Microsoft Bonsai](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/autonomous-systems-project-bonsai)** I helped companies implement **Reinforcement Learning** (RL) solutions to solve hairy control problems.

The basic approach was: Step 1: build a simulation. Step 2: train an algorithm to control that simulation. Step 3: deploy the trained algorithm on real hardware. Turns out that every one of those 3 steps is pretty hard and I worked across the entire problem space.

I first did this work as a **client-facing AI Engineer**, and later I switched over to **Product Management**, where I in charge of the **core AI algorithms and capabilities**. The features were shipped were learning directly from data ("Offline Reinforcement Learning"), increasing robustness in the face of imperfect simulations, and accelerating training speeds. 

Microsoft decided to discontinue this product, but I continue to believe in the approach.


### Active Learning and Materials Informatics
2019-2021

At **[Citrine Informatics](https://citrine.io/)** I helped top materials companies create better materials using machine learning. I started as **data scientist** and eventually worked as a **tech lead**, where I got to work with a team of data scientists and engineers. 

We used **bayesian optimization** *(in essence; find the most valuable experiments to run every iteration)* with some special materials featurizations. Using this technique we helped various companies achieve breakthrough insights in different systems, ranging from glass, to metals, to polymers. 

Beyond the technical execution of specific projects I helped companies develop their AI strategies; working with executives to create a vision, setting up data collection practises, and training their researchers in data-driven exploration.

I can't talk much about specific work I did, because most of it was highly secretive (I know.. very mysterious!), but I worked on these two project:
- [Case study: Rapid Polymer Screening using AI](https://citrine.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Rapid-Polymer-Screening-Using-AI.pdf)
- [Case study: Glass Development - Machine Learning Accelerates Research](https://citrine.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Case-Study-Glass-Development.pdf)

And I was a co-inventor on a patent:
[ Product design and materials development integration using a machine learning generated capability map ](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11004037B1/en)




### Automatic Information Extraction from Materials Science Journal Articles
2016-2019

In the [Olivetti Group](https://olivetti.mit.edu/) at **MIT** we built systems to **automatically extract information contained in materials science papers** (the input ingredients, the process, the resulting properties). Once you have that dataset, there is a lot you can do like creating comprehensive maps of what has/hasn't been tried to give other researchers new ideas, or automatically generate new synthesis paths for materials. 

The technology has come a long way since then. We were using Word2Vec (in later pipelines; BERT), created our own LSTM-based Named Entity Recognition systems trained on painstakingly labeled data, built table parsers, and more. 

You can read about this here: 
- [Inorganic Materials Synthesis Planning with Literature-Trained Neural Networks](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00995) 
- [Manufacturing variability; effects and characterization through text-mining](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/122216?show=full).
