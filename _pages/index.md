I am a **data scientist** with expertise in Natural Language Programming (NLP) and active learning. 

I am currently a tech lead at **Citrine Informatics** where I lead customer-facing teams to develop and apply machine learning algorithms to accelerate the development of new materials. Previously I was graduate researcher at **MIT**, where I got a dual graduate degrees in Technology & Policy and Computer Science, while conducting research in NLP to extract information from millions of academic journal articles. 

I am passionate about sustainability, innovation and policy, and how technology can help us solve impactful, complex problems.

In my spare time I run :runner: , cycle :bike: , and surf :surfer:. I have lived in 7 different countries across three continents :earth_africa:.
